## 🎮 About the Game

**Electron Runner** is a physics-based educational game that simulates the journey of an electron in its quest for stability. Players guide an electron (representing a hydrogen atom) through a dynamic environment filled with obstacles and power-ups, aiming to reach the final stage where it combines with another hydrogen and oxygen atom to form a **water molecule (H₂O)**.

The game not only provides entertainment but also **teaches basic physics and chemistry concepts**, making learning fun and interactive.

## 🕹 Game Features

- **⚡ Electron Movement**: The player controls an electron that gains speed, power, and score as it navigates obstacles.
- **🌍 Real-World Simulation**: The game mimics the process of forming a water molecule.
- **🔬 Physics-Based Mechanics**: Includes components like **Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, Inductors**, and **Diodes** with realistic interactions.
- **🆙 Power-ups & Boosts**: The electron can gain speed and power by interacting with elements.
- **🏆 Reward System**: Players earn points by lighting up bulbs and overcoming obstacles.
- **🎭 Multiple Characters**: Includes both **helpful and enemy** elements that affect gameplay.

## 📜 Game Mechanics

### 🎯 **Characters & Elements**
| Element        | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| **Electron** (Hydrogen Atom) | Main character, gains speed, score, and power. |
| **NP-Diode**  | Requires the electron to jump over it or lose speed. |
| **PN-Diode**  | Helps increase speed when passed through. |
| **Capacitor** | Acts like NP-Diode, requiring the player to avoid it. |
| **Resistor** | Reduces speed upon passing. If speed is 0, the game is lost. |
| **Inductor** | If speed >1, the electron passes; otherwise, it gets pulled in. |
| **Transistor** | Boosts power when passed through. |
| **Light Bulb** | If power ≥1, it lights up and rewards the player. |
| **Proton** | Acts as a projectile that eliminates obstacles. |
| **Oxygen + 2 Hydrogen** | The final stage, where the water molecule is formed. |

### 🏆 **Reward System**
- **Power**: Gained by passing through a **Transistor**.
- **Speed**: Increased by passing through an **NP-Diode**.
- **Score**: Earned when a **light bulb is activated**.
